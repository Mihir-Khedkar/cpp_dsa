A. Linear & Binary Search (CORE)

⭐ Linear search in array

⭐ Binary search (iterative)

Binary search (recursive)

First occurrence of element

Last occurrence of element

👉 These 5 alone are mandatory.



B. Binary Search Variants (VERY IMPORTANT)

⭐ Count occurrences of element

Search in rotated sorted array

Find peak element

Find floor and ceil of a number

If binary search feels shaky → stop here and practice more.



C. Sorting Algorithms

⭐ Bubble sort

⭐ Selection sort

Insertion sort

👉 Focus on:

Why they are slow

When insertion sort is useful



D. Divide & Conquer Sorting

⭐ Merge sort

Merge two sorted arrays

(Optional) Count inversions

You don’t need to memorize merge sort — understand it.
