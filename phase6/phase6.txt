Tree Basics (DO NOT RUSH)

⭐ Create binary tree

⭐ Print tree (inorder traversal)

Preorder traversal

Postorder traversal

Understand traversal deeply.



B. Level Order (QUEUE USE)

⭐ Level order traversal

Print level by level

Height / max depth of tree



C. Classic Tree Problems (CORE)

⭐ Count number of nodes

⭐ Sum of all nodes

Check if tree is identical

Mirror of a tree



D. Advanced Recursive Thinking

⭐ Diameter of binary tree

Check if tree is balanced

Lowest common ancestor

These separate syntax from thinking.



E. Binary Search Tree (BST)

⭐ Insert into BST

Search in BST

Find minimum and maximum

Validate BST



Optional (only if confident)

Kth smallest element in BST

Zigzag traversal
